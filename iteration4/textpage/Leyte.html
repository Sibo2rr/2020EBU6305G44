        Wright Bay naval battle is a naval battle happened in the Pacific battlefield of the Second World War near Wright island in the Philippines.<br>
        In terms of the total tonnage of warships put into the battlefield by the two armies, the lette Bay naval battle is the largest naval battle in history and the last aircraft carrier battle so far, which completely destroyed Japan's aircraft carrier power.<br>
        The naval battle lasted from October 20, 1944 to October 26, 1944. Within six days, the total tonnage of ships invested by the Japanese and allied forces exceeded 2 million tons, including 1.33 million tons for the allied fleet and 730000 tons for the Japanese Navy. 21 aircraft carriers, 21 battleships, 170 destroyers and nearly 2000 military aircraft participated in the battle.<br>
        After the Japanese army's defeat in Saipan, Mariana Islands and other battles, if it loses the Philippines or Taiwan again, the lifeline of Japan's "south line" resource transportation to its native land will be cut off, and its links with China, North Korea and its native land in Southeast Asia will be cut off. Japan therefore decided to put all its eggs in one basket in an attempt to repel the Allied landing forces on Leyte island and defeat its maritime forces. After several times of consideration, the Allies gave up attacking Taiwan and landed from the Philippines first, determined to land under the cover of superior forces, and defeated the Japanese Imperial Navy which came to support them.<br>
        As expected, the Japanese combined fleet, which was far inferior in number, was defeated. Thirteen heavy warships above cruisers were sunk, and Japan's sea-based and land-based aviation forces in the Philippines were eliminated, which seriously hit Japan's overall strength. From then on, Japan's joint fleet was no longer a strategic force in the Pacific War. This battle also laid the foundation for the US Army's successful capture of the Philippines and Okinawa.<br>
        Because of the hopelessness of the war situation, Japan launched the first organized suicide attack of the kamikaze special attack team in this battle.<br>
