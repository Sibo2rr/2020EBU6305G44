        The hundred regiment war was a large-scale offensive and anti "sweeping" campaign launched by the Eighth Route Army behind the enemy in North China during the Anti Japanese war. It was called "hundred regiment war" because the number of troops involved reached 105 regiments.<br>
        The hundred regiments war was the largest and longest campaign launched by the Eighth Route Army in North China during the stalemate of the Anti Japanese war.<br>
        The hundred regiments war is divided into three stages. The first stage is from August 20, 1940 to September 10, 1940. The central task is to destroy the traffic on Zhengtai road. From September 22, 1940 to the first ten days of October 1940 was the second stage. The main task was to continue to destroy the Japanese army's traffic lines and destroy the main Japanese strongholds in the Anti Japanese base areas. The third stage was from the first ten days of October 1940 to the 24th of January 1941. The main task was to counter the retaliatory "mopping up" of the Japanese army.<br>
        According to the statistics of the headquarters of the Eighth Route Army on December 10, 1940, during the first three and a half months of the hundred regiments war, 1824 large and small battles were carried out, which severely attacked the reactionary arrogance of the Japanese and puppet forces, effectively cooperated with the front battlefield operations of the Kuomintang forces, and greatly inspired the confidence of the whole country in the war of resistance against Japan.<br>
