        The battle of Songhu (also known as the battle of August 13, the second Songhu Anti Japanese War, and the second Shanghai incident in Japan) was the first large-scale battle between China and Japan in the Anti Japanese War, and also the largest and most tragic battle in the whole Sino Japanese war.<br>
        The battle of Songhu began on August 13, 1937. After the Lugouqiao Incident, Chiang Kai Shek took the initiative to counterattack in Shanghai in order to change the direction of Japanese invasion from north to south to east to West for long-term combat.<br>
        About 1 million Chinese and Japanese troops were involved in the battle. The battle itself lasted for three months. The Japanese army invested more than 200000 people in eight divisions and two brigades, and declared more than 40000 dead and wounded; The Chinese army has invested more than 800000 people in the most elite Central Training Corps, 87 divisions, 88 divisions, 148 divisions and 62 brigades, with 300000 casualties counted.<br>
        In the battle of Songhu, the Japanese army suffered heavy losses because of the Kuomintang's tenacious resistance. For China, this battle marked the real beginning of an all-out war between the two countries. After the Lugouqiao Incident, the regional conflict escalated into a all-out war, and completely smashed Japan's plan of "three months' destruction of China". Li Shengjiao, the leader of international law, once commented: "the Songhu battle won time for the inward movement of factories and materials in Shanghai and the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, and played an important role in China's adherence to the long-term Anti Japanese war."<br>
