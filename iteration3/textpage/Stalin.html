        The battle of Stalingrad was a battle that Nazi Germany fought for the southern city of Stalingrad in the Second World War.<br>
Stalingrad is the transportation throat of the central region of the Soviet Union to the important economic region in the south, and its strategic position is extremely important. If the German army captured Stalingrad and the Caucasus, it could attack Moscow to the north and the Persian Gulf to the south. To the West and south of Stalingrad are the main food, coal and oil producing areas of the Soviet Union. If the German army occupied the area, the Soviet Union would lose the important resources needed for the war.<br>
The battle of Stalingrad was the most serious strategic failure of Nazi Germany, which not only ended the offensive situation of the German Southern Group since 1941, but also directly caused the fundamental change of the overall power balance between the Soviet Union and Germany.<br>
The battle of Stalingrad was the turning point of the eastern front of the Second World War. Judging from the number of casualties, it was also the bloodiest battle in modern history. It was also famous for the casualties caused by the neglect of the differences between military and civilian.<br>
After the battle of Stalingrad, the Soviet Army pushed the front westward for more than 600 kilometers. The battlefield situation changed in favor of the Soviet army, and the morale of the axis group was greatly affected.<br>
