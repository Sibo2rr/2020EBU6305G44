        The battle of Britain was a large-scale air war launched by Nazi Germany against Britain from 1940 to 1941 during the Second World War.<br>
        The war was also the largest air battle in the Second World War. In addition to Britain and Germany, aircrew from New Zealand, Canada, Australia, South Africa, Jamaica, Sri Lanka, South Rhodesia and other countries belonging to the British Commonwealth also joined the British army; The exiled governments of many countries occupied by Nazi Germany, including Poland, Belgium, Czechoslovakia, France and other air forces retreated to Britain, also joined the ranks of defending Britain; At that time, the United States, which was neutral, also had volunteers to form a "Flying Eagle squadron" to fight side by side with Britain.<br>
        The war ended with the defeat of Nazi Germany on June 22, 1941. Due to the loss of too many fighters and pilots, and the inability to gain the air supremacy advantage in the English channel, and the inability to disintegrate Britain's ground and naval forces through air strikes, Germany had to give up the sea lion plan to invade Britain and began to formulate the Barbarosa plan to invade the Soviet Union.<br>
