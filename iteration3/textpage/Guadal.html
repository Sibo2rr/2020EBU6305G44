        The battle of Guadalcanal is a battle carried out by allied forces in the Pacific theater of World War II between August 7, 1942 and February 9, 1943 in Guadalcanal and its surrounding islands.<br>
        It was part of the alliance's strategic plan to protect shipping routes between the United States, Australia and New Zealand, and the beginning of the alliance's counter offensive in the Pacific.<br>
        This was the second major offensive by the Allies against Japan one month after the battle of Kokoda trail.<br>
        The battle of Guadalcanal Island started with the small landing battle of the US Army, and then the Japanese army increased their troops one by one in order to recapture the island, and launched an unprecedented battle at sea, land and air, which evolved into a decisive battle between Japan and its allies.<br>
        Both sides spent more than half a year in the fight, which resulted in the loss of a large number of warships and aircraft, and the casualties of Japan far exceeded those of the US military. In the end, Japan chose to withdraw because of its inability to engage in war of attrition. Finally, the U.S. military completely occupied Guadao, then seized the Solomon Islands, and finally the sea power of the entire South Pacific region. Therefore, the U.S. military began to carry out a strategic counterattack.<br>
        The battle of Guadalcanal is Japan's failure again after the battle of Midway, and it is also a turning point for Japan to move from its strategic superiority to its inferiority. From a worldwide perspective, the Allied counter offensive and victory in Guadalcanal at the end of 1942, together with the battle of Stalingrad and the battle of allaman at the same time, became the beginning of the strategic counter offensive stage for the allies.<br>
