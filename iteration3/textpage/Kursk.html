        In order to regain the strategic initiative and change the increasingly unfavorable situation, Hitler decided to launch a large-scale attack in the Kursk region to defeat the Soviet offensive. After learning of the situation, the supreme command of the Soviet Army decided to take advantage of the situation to temporarily turn to strategic defense, concentrate superior forces, eliminate the German forces, and create conditions for further counter offensive.<br>
        In order to carry out the battle of Kursk, both sides put the maximum forces they could concentrate into the battlefield.<br>
        In this battle, although the Soviet army suffered a great loss, it defeated the German army's attempt to turn the situation around. The German army was defeated by 30 divisions, resulting in the loss of 500000 soldiers, 1500 tanks, 3000 guns and more than 3700 planes.<br>
        Through this campaign, the Soviet Army's strategy and tactics were tested, and they fully grasped the strategic initiative. From then on, the German army completely lost its strategic offensive ability and had to turn to the whole line of defense.<br>
        Therefore, some scholars believe that the Kursk campaign is a turning point in the Soviet German battlefield.<br>
